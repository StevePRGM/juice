trying to make a generation algorithm

first ideas are doing one like spelunky, i.e. digger algorithm.
start with plain area, follow set of rules until you can no longer follow rules, guarenteed path a-b.
e.g. spelunky, 4x4 grid. start anywhere at the top (spawnpoint), go either down, right, or left 
(if not possible ignore option i.e. cannot go right if already on the furthest right tile), 
then stop once you can no longer go anywhere (endpoint).
always guarentees path.

it's going to be hard if it's only 16x9 tiles, but I'll have a go
